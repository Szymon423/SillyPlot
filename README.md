# Yet Another Plot Library
This is my attempt to create simple plot library for `C++`. Especially one that is willing to work on `Raspberry Pi` devices on `arm64` OS. 

> [!NOTE]
> This library will not display any plots. It can only save them to `.png`

## But Why?
Why to choose this library when you can use `python` and all it goodness like `matplotlib`?

Well.. I also do not know. But maybe when writing somethig that need to work without any other programs like amazing `gnuplot`, running on constrained hardware resources system maybe it is worth checking out on this something.
